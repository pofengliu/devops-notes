- Now and then, code quality becomes an issue in a team and everyone starts to talk about how we can improve unit test and code coverage, but not for long. Eventually, it's not a hot topic anymore as people get busy. But then, you will experience déjà vu probably within a year, because the same idea comes back the next year.
- ## Unit test and code review
	- Peer code review is part of LINE's engineer culture, as our CTO explained to us during OJT. Facebook states the most three important things in development as code review, code review *and* code review. Yes, the only way to address unit test and improve code quality is to make unit test part of our engineer culture, and code review is here to help.

	  Boy scout rule for coding, from [{codemotion}](https://codemotionworld.com/)
- Follow this boy scout rule which recommends reviewers to check if unit tests supplement new code and bug fixes during a review, and by continuously doing this, code coverage should expand or at least remain the same. For example, if code coverage drops, a reviewee should explain to the team the difficulties he/she is having and the reasons for not adding more tests. If all agree upon the explanation and has no issues, he/she can proceed. Otherwise, the reviewee shall fix it!
