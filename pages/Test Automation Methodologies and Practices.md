- ## Three levels of test isolation
	- #### TestContainers (mocks, stubs)
- ## TestContext & default objects
- ## Other test practices for stabilities
	- Tests should be useful:  integrated and AC first
	- Tests should be maintainable: tests are written to be refactorable in the future
	- Tests should be reliable: test isolation, run 20 times in a row before accepting PR
	- Tests should be fast: mocking is a necessary. 80% uses mocking data, 20% e2e integration
