- ## Three levels of test isolation
	- #### TestContainers (mocks, stubs)
- ## TestContext & default objects
- ## Other practices
	- Tests should be useful:  integrated and AC first
	- Tests should be maintainable: tests are written to be refactorable in the future
		- TestContext for maintainabilities
		- ESlint - to make sure there are no lint errors
	- Tests should be reliable: test isolation, run 20 times in a row before accepting PR
		- Leverage PullRequest checks

	- Tests should be fast: mocking is a necessary. 80% uses mocking data, 20% e2e integration
		- Parallelism is a must as features grow faster than you think
