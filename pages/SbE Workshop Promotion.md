- Title: Specification by Example workshop
  
  Description:
  
  In the past decade, most development practices have strived to build software the “right” way, yet “Specification by Example (SbE)” is going to guide you how to build the right product effectively! In the session, we will explain to you how SbE can help team:
- define requirement scope and reduce communication efforts
- conduct Sprint backlog refinement meeting and produce acceptance criteria (AC)
- get higher quality and boost CI/CD adoption
  
  
  
  SbE is an up-front design methodology, a collaboration tool and it comes along with more benefits including what’s specified above, though it is powerful but easily to do it wrong. This hands-on workshop will show you how SbE bridge the Sprint planning and the whole development lifecycle and more...
