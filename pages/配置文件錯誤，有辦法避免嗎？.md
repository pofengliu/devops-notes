- >Config pushes need to be treated with at least the same care as you do with program binaries, and I argue more because unit testing config is difficult without the compiler. You need integration tests. ***You need to do canaried and staged rollouts of config changes because the only good place to test your config change is in the theatre of production, in the face of the actual users exercising the code paths enabled by your config.*** ==Global synchronised config change = outage.==                ~[Jamie Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/jaqx0r), SRE at Google
