title:: 實例化需求 (Specification by Example)/Key Process Patterns

- ## Deriving scope from goals
  團隊以客戶的業務目標開始，經由協作了解背後的價值並界定預計達成的目標範圍，產生使用者故事 (user stories) 並且能簡單舉例 (high level examples) 說明之。
- ## Specifying Collaboratively
  SbE 的重點之一，經由團隊的共同討論 (face-to-face with whiteboard) 並探索出最佳解法 (solutions)。

- ## Determine Key Examples
  團隊成員通過工作坊的方式制定需求規格，通常來說，先用實例來描述，推測一些規律，轉成用表格表達，可能發現更準確的規律。
  Every acceptance criterion generates new examples; every example generates new scenarios. Teams should refine their specifications to merge similar examples, reject the ones that introduce noise, and choose the most meaningful or descriptive ones.
	- ### Complex specifications
	  * Don’t invite discussions
	  * Technical model is misaligned with the business model
	  * Described at the wrong level of abstraction
	  * Usually means refining a story isn't done
	- ### Key examples
	- * A small number of relatively simple scenario
	- * Easy to understand and implementation
	- * Easy to evaluate and argue about boundary conditions
	- * Easier to discover and resolve inconsistencies
	- * (raw examples won't provide above two advantages)
	- right level of abstraction to describe situation better
	- satisfy business needs faster
	- modularised software reduces future maintenance costs
- ## Refining the specification
  sdfs
	- ### Good Specifications
	  * Have a concise description
	  * Have a clear model
	  * Use business language
	  * Show a clear connection between inputs and outputs
	  * ==Describe (focus on) WHAT not HOW==
	  * ==Avoid GUI specifics==
- ## Automating validation without changing specifications
- ## Validating frequently
- ## Evolving a documentation system
