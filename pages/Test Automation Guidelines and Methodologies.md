- ## Test Automation Guidelines
	- Tests should be useful: smoke and AC first
	- Tests should be maintainable: tests are written to be refactorable in the future
	- Tests should be reliable: test isolation, run 20 times in a row before accepting PR
		- (1st phase) all cases 20 times: takes long time - parallel run (cms - test isolation), use retry
		- (2nd phase) same package 20 times - after we gets solid baseline
		- (3rd phase) new test cases 20 times
	- Tests should be fast: mocking is a necessary. 80% uses mocking data, 20% e2e integration
